"longdress" folder contains 3 .zip files in which four different distortion on "longdress_vox10_1051.ply" from the JPEG Pleno Database: 8i Voxelized Full Bodies (8iVFB v2) - A Dynamic Voxelized Point Cloud Dataset are stored. All the names are explicative of the characteristics (e.g. "longdress_vox10_1051_2/3(x10^5)_AddEdge_13_25.ply" on "longdress_vox10_1051.ply" it has been selected a portion with 2x10^5th index as starting point and 3x10^5th index as ending point, was modified using the distortion named "AddEdge", selecting the 13% of the points of the portion, with distortion value of 25, in this case is the adding fraction to the original point).

Contains: 
    - three .zip files: 
         -- "longdress_vox10_1051_AddEdge" : in the "AddEdge" distortion the position of the voxel of the original point cloud is increased by a fraction of the original position defined by the distortion value. (e.g. "longdress_vox10_1051_2/3(x10^5)_AddEdge_13_25.ply" corresponds to 25).                                           
         -- "longdress_vox10_1051_Noise" : in the "Noise" distortion it is added gaussian noise, using a snr value equals to the distortion value (e.g. "longdress_vox10_1051_2/3(x10^5)_Noise_13_25.ply" corresponds to 25).                                     
         -- "longdress_vox10_1051_Downsample" : 
             --- "longdress_vox10_1051_DownsampleGrid" : in the "DownsampleGrid" distortion it is used the pcdownsample Matlab function, which downsamples the point cloud, using a grid step value equals to the distortion value (e.g. "longdress_vox10_1051_2/3(x10^5)_DownsampleGrid_5.ply" corresponds to 5).
             --- "longdress_vox10_1051_DownsampleRand" : in the "DownsampleRand" distortion it is used the pcdownsample Matlab function, which downsamples the point cloud, selecting a random value of points equals to the distortion value (e.g."longdress_vox10_1051_2/3(x10^5)_DownsampleRand_13.ply" corresponds to 13).
